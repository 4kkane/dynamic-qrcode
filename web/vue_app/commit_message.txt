feat: Refactor QR code generator page to be mobile-first

This commit refactors the main App.vue component to provide a responsive, mobile-first user experience.

Key changes:
- Replaced the desktop-oriented layout with a flexible, single-column layout that adapts to smaller screen sizes.
- Improved the styling of form controls (inputs, selects, buttons) for better usability on touch devices.
- Introduced a clean, modern design with a refined color palette and typography.
- The core application logic for interacting with the backend API remains unchanged.
